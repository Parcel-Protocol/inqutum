/**
 * The invoice lifecycle: one state machine, shared by the backend API, both
 * storage backends and the Next.js client.
 *
 * Before this module "what may happen to an invoice in state X" was inferred
 * separately in each place that needed it: `if (status !== 'PENDING')` in the
 * memory store, `WHERE status = 'PENDING'` in SQL, `checkInvoiceIsPayable` in
 * the verifier and `isActionableInvoice` in the UI. Those agree today because
 * someone kept them agreeing. This file is the single place the rules are
 * written down; the stores, handlers and UI ask it instead of re-deriving them.
 *
 * The table below is deliberately data, not code, so it can be listed by the
 * API (`GET /api/invoices/lifecycle`), rendered in docs and exhaustively
 * asserted by tests.
 *
 * What the model does NOT decide is time. Whether a PENDING invoice is still
 * inside its expiry window is a fact about the clock, and stays a guard in the
 * storage layer (`expires_at > NOW()`), next to the write it protects.
